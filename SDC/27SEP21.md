# Day 01 of SDC - September 27, 2021

## Opening Thoughts:

Today, I am a little anxious to get started with SDC. It's going to be a lot more solo work but hopefully I will still be able to work with and colaborate with my teammates.

### Daily STAR:

#### Situation

It is the first day of SDC and our group is meeting together for the first time.

#### Task

Do decide responsibilities up amongst team members and put together our Code of Conduct as well as our Trello ticketing system.

#### Actions

The following actions were taken...

- Created our Repository
- Create Ticketing System using Trell
- Created Code of Conduct
- Decided on PostgressQL for database

#### Results

Our group was able to complete all of the tasks that were required for the first day.

## Closing Thoughts:

So far our group seems to work very well together. While this is mostly a solo project, I look forward to using my fellow team members and other cohort mates to crush this sprint.
