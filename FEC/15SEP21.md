# Day 08 of FEC - September 00, 2021

## Daily Thoughts:

Today was a bit rough. I was feeling down and unmotivated due to losing members of our cohort and my productivity suffered. I'm hoping that tomorrow I will be able to wake up feeling refreshed and ready to go. We worked as a group for a decent portion of the day. We ran into some issues merging out local repos into the main branch but after some hard work and dedication we were able to get it working properly.

### Daily Breakdown:

#### Situation

The group is continuing to work solo on our individual widgets.

#### Task

Continue implementing individual widgets and continually update and protect main branch.

#### Actions

Our group started out working solo but due to some main branch issues, worked as a team to resolve the bugs.

- Implemented Answers section of widget
- Attempted to merge individual widget progress to main branch
- Temporatily broke the main branch
- Spent time as a group fixing and eventually merging all of our individual progress.

#### Results

We have made significant progress on our FEC project and have a good GIT workflow. If we continue to make PRs regularly we should be able to avoid any major conflicts in the future.

### Obstacles

We hit some snags merging our solo progress.

- Main branch was broken by uploading individual work directly to main branch.

### Objectives

To continue implementing my Q&A widget and get most functionality ready for react context.
