# Day 06 of FEC - September 13, 2021

## Daily Thoughts:

Today, my group was able to meet up and finalize the framing of our webpage. Now we are all able to start creating our react components without interfering with each other. We also went over some different tests with Jest and React Testing Library. Overall I think it was a productive day and sets our group up for success.

### Daily Breakdown:

#### Situation

Our group has reconvened after our weekend of mostly relaxing. We needed to finalize our webpage and testing strategy so that we could finally break off and begin solo coding our components.

#### Task

Finsih framing the webpage and testing strategy to enable easier implementation of our components.

#### Actions

The following actions were taken...

- We did our daily standup and identified we needed to finish the framework and testing.
- We went over example tests for Jest and RTL.
- We completed framing our webpage.
- We began solo coding our individual widgets.

#### Results

Due to the extra time we spent planning, I believe our group is perfectly situated for success in FEC>

### Obstacles

We have not run into many obstacles yet. Some possible obstacles to avoid, however, are:

- Needing API calls to get data
- Issues passing propduct info to components

### Objectives

To begin implementation of the questions and answers widget and track possible APIs needed in the future.
