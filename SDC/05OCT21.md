# Day 00 of SDC - October 05, 2021

## Opening Thoughts:

Today, I am going to begin the process for deploying my server to AWS.

### Daily Breakdown:

#### Situation

My local machine has been optimized. Now I need to upload my server to run on AWS and begin optimizations.

#### Task

Learn Docker to begin AWS deployment process.

#### Actions

The following actions were taken...

- Researched Docker
- Refactored code to enable using Docker
- Using a docker-compose.yml I was able to create docker images of my server, database and NGinX as my load balancer

#### Results

After many hours of bug hunting, I was finally able to launch and my server, db and lb from a Docker container.

## Closing Thoughts:

I wasn't able to get my server/db/lb deployed to AWS but I was able to get some experience using Docker which will come in handy. I want to deploy to AWS today.
