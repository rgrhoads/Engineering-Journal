# Day 08 of SDC - October 04, 2021

## Opening Thoughts:

Today I will be writing my K6 scripts to stress test my server and begin the process of deploying my website with AWS.

### Daily Breakdown:

#### Situation

After completing my PSQL queries I need to begin stress testing my server on my local machine.

#### Task

To write K6 stress tests and optimize the server.

#### Actions

- Wrote K6 script testing products
- Wrote K6 script testing features
- Wrote K6 script testing styles
- Wrote K6 script testing related
- Refactored PSQL Queries to improve response time
- Used hash indexing to reduce response time

#### Results

I am now able to complete a single request for each endpoint in 4ms and my server can handle over 1000 vus per second for a duration of 30s with 100% success rate with an average response time of under 100ms.

## Closing Thoughts:

I am happy with the results of my optimization. I now need to deploy my server to AWS so I can tackle those optimizations.
