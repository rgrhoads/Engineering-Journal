# Day 07 of FEC - September 00, 2021

## Daily Thoughts:

Today was a fairly productive day. It was the first day where we really solo coded for the entire day. It was nice being able to really dive into some code and research different ways to implement my ideas.

### Daily Breakdown:

#### Situation

It's the first full solo coding day.

#### Task

Begin to complete tickets and implement features in Q&A widget.

#### Actions

I bounced around between tickets so my actions were a little more chaotic than normal.

- I researched hooks with the intention of incorporating them into my react component.
- I was able to build the skeleton for how my widget will look.
- I began formulating ideas on how to product information through multiple files.

#### Results

Due to time spent researching and implementing my ideas, I was able to flesh out the skeleton of my widget. It looks mostly like it is going to and has the necessary form.

### Obstacles

The only obstacle I have run into is using mock data instead of using data from the API and using context to pass it around. It hasn't fully blocked me but will soon.

### Objectives

To implement the Question List as well as its subcomponents.
