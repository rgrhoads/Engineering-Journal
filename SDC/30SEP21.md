# Day 04 of SDC - September 30, 2021

## Opening Thoughts:

Today, I am a little lost on what exactly we need to accomplish going forward. Hopefully I can gain some better insight in our daily standup.

### Daily Breakdown:

#### Situation

I have completed the ETL and need to create the APIs for Products.

#### Task

To initialize the server and build out APIs for accessing the database.

#### Actions

- Initialize Server
- Install Dependencies
- Connect Server to DB
- Troubleshoot Server/DB connection (Help Desk Ticket with Matt)
- Complete Get requests for products and features.

#### Results

After a lot of headaches and bug hunting I was able to get my server successfully connected to my database and build out 2 of the endpoints.

## Closing Thoughts:

I am comfortable with my current progress. I see the potential for a lot of things to start piling up. I need to do a better job tracking my required deliverables throughout the cohort, not just with SDC.
