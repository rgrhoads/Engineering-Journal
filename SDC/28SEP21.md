# Day 02 of SDC - September 28, 2021

## Opening Thoughts:

After getting some initial setup out of the way, I am ready to compare my No/SQL DBMSs.

### Daily Breakdown:

#### Situation

I needed to research a NoSQL and a SQL DBMS in order to make a decision on which to use for my SDC project.

#### Task

To research PostgreSQL and Neo4J in order to design schema for both DBMS's.

#### Actions

Today was mostly a research and exploration day.

- Collaborated with classmates on DB structure
- Researched creating PostgreSQL Database
- Researched creating Neo4J Database
- Created Diagram of PostgreSQL Database
- Created Diagram of MongooseDB Database

#### Results

I was able to finish the diagram for SDC using a PostgreSQL database.

## Closing Thoughts:

I am a little nervous about performing the ETL process with my current schema.
